# Voider Game

## 1. Downloading source code tutorial

    Clone the project from the github link: https://github.com/ngoinhaoto/8bit-android-project
    
    Unzip the zip file, and you would get a folder like this
    
    Open the folder in Android Studio
    
    Navigate into the directory: android/src/com/voider/game/AndroidLauncher.java
    
    Double click the AndroidLauncher
    
    Right click on the AndroidLauncher class then click Run ‘AndroidLauncher’ then the game would be run on your Emulator.
    
    After running the AndroidLauncher the game should be run on your virtual device like this. Keep in mind that we used the Pixel 6 Pro to test and run the game so you should install Pixel 6 Pro on your device to run the game for the best experience, or you can test your game on your physical device by plugging your device into your PC/Laptop.
     
      Also you might encounter an error that related to the location of your sdk directory. In that case simply go to local.properties file and edit it

      You can edit the sdk.dir here. If you can’t find your sdk, simply type sdk into your help bar, click on sdk manager
    
      Then copy the Android SDK Location and paste it back into the local.properties

## 2. Downloading the game to your phone

    You can play the game on your physical phone by plugging your phone into your laptop/PC or downloading the apk file in this drive to your phone and play on it. Keep in mind that we only tested on our phones(which are Xiaomi K20, and Techno pova 4 pro so the game might be buggy on your device). So it’s still best to test the game using Pixel 6 Pro in the Android Studio emulator.
